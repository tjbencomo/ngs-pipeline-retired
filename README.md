# variant-discovery-pipeline
Implementation of the Broad's [Best Practices Pipelines for Variant Discovery](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/workflow) for use on Stanford's Sherlock Compute Cluster. The project consists of two pipelines: PreProcessing and VariantCalling. PreProcessing performs data preprocessing on an individual sample. VariantCalling performs Mutect2 variant calling for a normal/tumor pair of samples.
